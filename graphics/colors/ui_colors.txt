Oxygen is a colorless and odorless gas, so it doesn't have a distinct color. However, in video games and visual representations, oxygen is often associated with a light blue or sky blue color. This is because the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions and makes the sky appear blue to our eyes.

You can use a light blue color to represent oxygen in your game. Here are a couple of hex color suggestions:

    Light Blue: #87CEEB
    Sky Blue: #87CEFA

Keep in mind that these colors are just suggestions, and you can choose a shade of blue that best fits your game's aesthetics and visual style.
